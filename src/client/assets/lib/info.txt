Stuff like bootstrap should go here, BUT care must be taken when building/compiling for production and ignore this folder.
 Files should be pulled from here during development and live reload.

 But, on the other hand, these libraries should be installed with npm, so they shouldn't even be in here, only in the build folder.

 Might just need to delete this folder at some point.

 Stuff is going to be pulled into here from /node_modules/ to help with production.
  (For example when a library does not load from the cdn.)
